NAME
       tload - graphic representation of system load average

SYNOPSIS
       tload [-V] [-s scale] [ -d delay ] [tty]

DESCRIPTION
       tload  prints  a graph of the current system load average to the speci-
       fied tty (or the tty of the tload process if none is specified).

   Options
       The -s scale option allows a vertical scale to  be  specified  for  the
       display (in characters between graph ticks); thus, a smaller value rep-
       resents a larger scale, and vice versa.

       The -d delay sets the delay between graph updates in seconds.


FILES
       /proc/loadavg load average information


SEE ALSO
       ps(1), top(1), uptime(1), w(1)


BUGS
       The -d delay option sets the time argument for an alarm(2); if -d 0  is
       specified, the alarm is set to 0, which will never send the SIGALRM and
       update the display.
